# code-sandbox-js-objects SheCodes Challenge

I created this code on Code Sandbox. This was part of a SheCodes Challenge I was given after a lesson in SheCodes. This lesson brushed on the topic of JS Objects. In this challenge, I created an object called forecast which contains the day and temp as key value pairs.
